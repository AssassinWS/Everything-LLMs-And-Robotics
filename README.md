# Everything-LLMs-And-Robotics
Aspiring to be the world's LARGEST Github repo for LLMs + Robotics Papers, Project Demos, Courses and more!

This repo contains: 
* RESEARCH PAPERS 
* PROJECT DEMOS 
* COURSES/PEDAGOGY

And everything else related to the intersection of LLMs and Robotics!  


# List of papers I should add 

* PaLM-E 
* Almost everything from Chelsea Finn's lab 
* Microsoft Drone Paper 
* Orangewood Labs Demo 
* Boston Dynamics Demo 
* Overall I want to find over 100 things on this. Once I do that it'll help with marketing (so far I've compiled over 100 + items, 3 times as large as the next largest repo on LLMs + Robotics I could find on GitHub, but I think we can be even more thorough.)


# Large Inspiration From and Gratitude Towards:

* [CS199: Stanford Robotics Independent Study](https://pupper-independent-study.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (Will be an official class next winter!)
* [GPT-RIPL](https://github.com/GT-RIPL/Awesome-LLM-Robotics)


This repo contains a curative list of papers using Large Language/Multi-Modal Models for Robotics/RL. Template from awesome-Implicit-NeRF-Robotics
