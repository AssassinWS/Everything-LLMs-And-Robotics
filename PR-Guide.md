## WHY PULL REQUESTS? 
In other repositories, such as [awesome-cv](https://github.com/jbhuang0604/awesome-computer-vision) there is the option for email, but I chose to not do that to ensure that every update is treated the same and is in one place. More details are [here.](https://jrin771.github.io) 

EVENTUALLY FIX THE LINK HERE SO THAT IT GOES TO THE RIGHT PLACE BUT FOR NOW IT'S A PLACEHOLDER

```

ERROR IDENTIFIED: [README.MD/PROJECT DEMO/SPOT GPT], The link is dead 

ERROR FIX: [README.MD/PROJECT DEMO/SPOT GPT], The link was replaced with a working link

## ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES <a name="administrative-changes"></a>
This is more informal since it is intended to be a catch-all, but if you have an idea for how to improve Everything-LLMs-And-Robotics then follow this format, which if approved will be implemented ASAP. Try to keep suggestions as small and modular. If you have a very big idea, send multiple pull requests to allow for your vision to be more clearly articulated: 
``` 
WHAT IS YOUR IDEA: Brief description
"SO WHAT?" (WHY SHOULD WE DO THIS): Brief Description
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THIS?: Brief Description 
```  

For example: 

WHAT IS YOUR IDEA: I think we should add a new section for twitter accounts that people should follow in LLMs + Robotics

"SO WHAT?" (WHY SHOULD WE DO THIS): This would help to further strengthen the community.

HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THIS?: We can create a new section in README.md and a new PR format in PR GUIDE.md
