## WHY PULL REQUESTS? 
In other repositories, such as [awesome-cv](https://github.com/jbhuang0604/awesome-computer-vision) there is the option for email, but I chose to not do that to ensure that every update is treated the same and is in one place. More details are in Good Practices.md

Go to this file (how-do-I-do-a-pull-request.md) and it offers a step-by-step walkthrough for how to do a pull request.

"SO WHAT?" (WHY SHOULD WE DO THIS): Brief Description
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THIS?: Brief Description 
```  

For example: 

WHAT IS YOUR IDEA: I think we should add a new section for twitter accounts that people should follow in LLMs + Robotics
