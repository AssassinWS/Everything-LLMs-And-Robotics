## FOR PROJECTS 

Do this

## FOR DEMOS 

Do that 

## WHY DO I ONLY HAVE PULL REQUESTS? 
In other repositories, such as awesome-cv (INCLUDE LINK HERE TO THEM) they have the option for email, but I chose to not do that to ensure that every update is treated the same (equity) and so that every update is in one place (organization and efficiency).
